# Audio_summarization
Audio Transcription Summarization Lambda Function
Overview
This AWS Lambda function automates the process of summarizing large audio transcription files stored in AWS S3. Upon detecting a new file in a specified bucket, it fetches the content, sends it to a RunPod Serverless endpoint powered by a language model, and stores the generated summary in another S3 location.

# Model Recommendation
Primary Model: google/flan-t5-xl
Justification:

Model type: Encoder-decoder (Seq2Seq), effective for summarization tasks.

Input Length: Supports inputs up to ~2,048 tokens — suitable for medium-length texts but can be chunked for longer inputs.

Output Quality: Fine-tuned for instruction following and performs well in zero/few-shot tasks.

Resource Efficiency: Relatively lightweight compared to larger models like flan-t5-xxl, making it more manageable on RunPod endpoints.

Deployment: Easy to deploy on vLLM or Transformers pipelines; Hugging Face compatible.

Note: For ultra-long transcriptions (~10,000 words), consider future upgrade to models with 32k+ context like mistralai/Mixtral, longformer, or claude-3 if support becomes available via RunPod.

# Lambda Function Logic
Trigger: Automatically invoked when a .txt transcription file is uploaded to an input S3 bucket.

Parse Event: Extracts bucket name and object key from S3 event.

Download Transcription: Uses boto3 to stream and read the file from S3.

Summarization Request:

Sends content to RunPod /run endpoint via requests.

Monitors job status with polling on /status endpoint until completion.

Store Summary:

Uploads the resulting summary to an output S3 bucket or prefix using boto3.

# Design Decisions
Polling Approach: Lambda polls the /status endpoint every few seconds. This works under the standard Lambda timeout limits (default max 15 mins).

File Size Handling: Large input text is streamed from S3 and tokenized in chunks if needed (future enhancement).

Error Handling:

Catches S3 access errors.

Validates RunPod responses.

Handles timeout or failure during summary job.

# Alternative Architecture: RunPod Pulls from S3 (Presigned URLs)
Pros:
RunPod directly fetches large files — no Lambda file transfer.

Reduced Lambda execution time and cost.

Cons:
Requires a custom RunPod worker that can handle S3 pre-signed URLs.

More setup complexity (Docker, RunPod worker deployment).

This approach is ideal if processing time frequently exceeds Lambda's max timeout.

# Testing Strategy (Conceptual)
Before using real keys:

Mock S3 Events locally.

Use moto library for S3 mocks.

Stub the RunPod API using local Flask mock server.

Print all intermediate payloads for debugging.
